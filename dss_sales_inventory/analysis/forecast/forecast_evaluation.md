## Model Limitations

- Holt's Linear method captures level and linear trend but assumes no seasonality.
- May over/under-estimate if recent data shows non-linear changes or external shocks.
- Forecast quantity forced ≥ 0; negative trend extrapolations are clipped.
- Short-term (28 days) only - not suitable for long-term strategic planning.
